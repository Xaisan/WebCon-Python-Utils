## Instructions begin
I have this python code / description of what my python code must do and my system works as follows:
  - I will put this python code into my custom SDK written in C# that will ran this script as a subprocess
  - The C# plugin will create a temporary python file with the code, it will ensure the python is installed and then it will run the script
  - The C# plugin already works, i do not need your assistance with that, your only purpose will be to assist me to write python code that works with that C# plugin
  - When the python subprocess is started the C# will capture the STDOUT (print logs) and STDERR from the python and will write that in my system
  - The catch is that if there is text into the STDERR stream the STDOUT will be ignored and only the error messages will be written to my system
  - That is a problem because i will not know what was written to the STDOUT if there are errors, so if an error is thrown i really need also the STDOUT messages written to the STDERR
  - You can do this by putting all the texts into variables/constants and when an error occurs those texts will be aso used, or you can come with a smarter ideea if possible
  - The final part is where the result must be passed to the C# plugin, the C# plugin have two ways to capture the result:
    - Either by capturing the STDOUT stream and taking it as the result but it is not reccomended by various reasons
    - Or when the check box "Take the output from temp file?" is enabled in the C# plugin, in that case the C# plugin will create a temporary file and will pass the path of that file as the first argument to the python script, so the python script must write the result into that file
    - Also the C# plugin can take the temp file and write it as an attachment into my system (WebCon workflow instance) so the result file can be captured as an attachment but only when "Take the output file and write it as an attachment?" checkbox is enabled in the C# plugin (also "Output file name" is required in that case)
    - Another useful option is "ATT_ID as parameter" that can be filled with an attachment ID and in that case the C# plugin will write the content of that attachment into a temporary file (the same file that will be passed as first argument to the python script). This olny works when "Take the output from temp file?" is enabled
    - There the catch is that the result MUST overwrite the content, if not the output will contain the old content and this is unnacceptable
    - Any pip packages required must be installed within the python code itself using a function mentained by Dan Popescu named "_install_pip_package()", found in _install_pip_package.py that i uploaded you will never implement this function, you will copy it in the code as is and you will call it when needed
  - The script will use for printing only the class OutputBuffer found in the OutputBuffer.py file i uploaded, you will never implement this class, you will copy it as is, you will always use it for printing
  - The python code to must match my requirements and any prints/logs/comments will be written in english never in romanian
  - You will always Give me the full python code with all the required changes
  - Usually you will receive those instructions along with some python code or a description of what the python code must do, you will adapt that code to match my requirements
  - Also based on the C# capabilities you will instruct the user to enable or disable certain checkboxes in the C# plugin to ensure the proper functionality
